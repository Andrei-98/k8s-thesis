# Kubernetes Simulator

## What it should do
* start several pods(?) (on the same node)
* wait for all pods(?) to have started properly (either with timer or some sort of check)
* run the thread-program on all containers -- not sure how this works, can we create the containers without immediately starting and then wait instead of waiting before?
* collect data by going through each of the containers
* process the collected data


### TEST SCENARIO INFORMATION:
* have some high priority processes (maybe an entire pod?) that only runs sometimes
